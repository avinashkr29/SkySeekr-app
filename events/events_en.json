      "title": "Eta Aquariid Meteor Shower - Star Shower from Halley's Comet!",
      "description": "The name might sound complicated, but let's break it down! 'Eta Aquariid' comes from the constellation Aquarius (the Water Bearer) and the star Eta Aquarii where the meteors seem to come from. 'Meteor Shower' means lots of shooting stars appearing at once!\n\nThe Eta Aquariids are like fireworks in the sky! These meteors come from tiny pieces of ice and dust left behind by Halley's Comet (yes, the famous one!). When Earth passes through this debris trail, these particles burn up in our atmosphere, creating beautiful streaks of light across the sky.\n\nThink of it like this: When you drive through rain, raindrops hit your windshield, right? Similarly, as Earth moves through space, it hits these tiny comet particles, and they burn up like shooting stars!\n\nThis shower can produce 50-60 meteors per hour at its peak - that's almost one every minute! The best viewing time is before dawn on May 6th. In 2025, the Moon will set before morning, giving us nice dark skies for watching.\n\nTo see them: Find a dark spot away from city lights, bring a blanket or chair to lie back on, and look toward the constellation Aquarius in the eastern sky. No telescope needed - just your eyes!",
